## 1. INTRODUCTION TO AMPED FIVE

**Amped FIVE** is a forensic-grade video and image enhancement platform containing 140+ scientifically validated filters organized into 12 logical workflow categories. Unlike consumer photo editing software, Amped FIVE is designed specifically for law enforcement, forensic laboratories, and legal proceedings where evidence integrity, chain of custody, and scientific reproducibility are paramount.

**Core Philosophy**: Amped FIVE follows the **Image Generation Model** - understanding how defects were introduced during capture (distortion → blur → compression → noise), then applying corrections in reverse order to achieve optimal restoration.

**Key Differentiators**:
- Transparent processing with full audit trails
- Court-admissible enhancement workflows
- Preservation of original evidence (non-destructive)
- Scientific validation of all algorithms
- Comprehensive reporting and documentation tools
