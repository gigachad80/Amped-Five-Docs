### 2.4 DEBLUR MODULE (Restoration)
**Purpose**: Remove motion blur, defocus blur, and atmospheric turbulence

#### **Filters & Sub-Filters**:

**Motion Deblur**
- **What it does**: Removes linear motion blur with consistent direction
- **When to use**: License plates with horizontal streak, panning camera blur, linear object motion
- **Key parameters**: 
  - **Angle** (0-180°): Direction of motion blur
  - **Size** (pixels): Length of blur streak (measure with ruler tool)
  - **Strength** (0.7-1.0): Deblurring intensity
- **Situation**: Vehicle license plate streaking across frame at constant velocity
- **Example**: Traffic camera - "Identify blur angle 15° (diagonal right-down) → Measure blur length 28px → Motion Deblur: angle 15°, size 28, strength 0.9 → Characters become legible"
- **Measurement technique**: Use line tool to measure blur streak length in pixels
- **Workflow position**: Apply AFTER denoise, BEFORE sharpening
- **Limitation**: Does NOT work if blur direction changes frame-to-frame (use Variable Motion Deblur instead)

**Variable Motion Deblur**
- **What it does**: Handles frame-varying blur with different angles/sizes per frame
- **When to use**: Accelerating/decelerating vehicle, changing camera pan speed, complex motion
- **Key parameters**: 
  - Keyframe selection (every 5-10 frames typical)
  - Per-keyframe angle/size adjustment
  - Interpolation method between keyframes
- **Situation**: Car approaching camera - blur changes from 45° (distant) to 5° (close) as perspective changes
- **Example**: Chase footage - "Frame 1: angle 45°, size 35px → Frame 50: angle 20°, size 22px → Frame 100: angle 5°, size 12px → Software interpolates intermediate frames → Smooth blur correction across sequence"
- **Workflow**: Mark keyframes every 10 frames, adjust parameters, let software interpolate between
- **Advantage**: Professional-grade blur correction for complex motion scenarios
- **Time investment**: More manual than Motion Deblur, but handles situations where Motion Deblur fails

**Optical Deblur**
- **What it does**: Removes defocus/out-of-focus blur (no directional component)
- **When to use**: Subject beyond focal plane, shallow depth-of-field, camera auto-focus error
- **Key parameters**: 
  - **PSF Size** (5-30): Point spread function - how much light spreads
  - **Strength** (0.5-0.9): Deblurring intensity
  - **ROI**: Apply to specific region only
- **Situation**: Facial image where subject is beyond camera focus distance
- **Example**: Blurry face in background - "PSF Size 15 → Strength 0.7 → Apply to facial ROI only → Facial features sharpen while avoiding artifacts in focused foreground"
- **Visual characteristic**: Uniform softness across entire image (no streaks or direction)
- **Caution**: Can amplify noise; apply denoise first if image is noisy
- **Regional application**: Better to apply only to out-of-focus region rather than entire image

**Nonlinear Deblur**
- **What it does**: Handles complex simultaneous motion (camera shake + object movement)
- **When to use**: Handheld camera with subject motion, erratic movement patterns
- **Key parameters**: Motion model selection, iteration count
- **Situation**: Handheld phone video of moving person (both camera and subject moving)
- **Example**: Body camera footage during foot pursuit - "Nonlinear Deblur → Motion model: Complex → Iterations 10 → Addresses both handheld shake and subject movement"
- **Computational cost**: HIGH - significant processing time required
- **Realistic expectations**: 10-20% improvement in very difficult cases
- **Last resort**: Use only when Motion/Optical deblur insufficient

**Turbulence Deblur**
- **What it does**: Removes atmospheric turbulence effects (heat haze, mirage, thermal shimmer)
- **When to use**: Long-distance surveillance in heat, high-altitude drone footage, desert/hot pavement conditions
- **Key parameters**: Strength (0.3-0.7), turbulence model
- **Situation**: Building surveillance camera viewing across hot parking lot in summer
- **Example**: Rooftop camera 200m distance - "Turbulence Deblur → Strength 0.5 → Reduces heat shimmer distortion → Subject features stabilize"
- **Specialized use**: Only for specific atmospheric conditions
- **Rare application**: Most forensic work does NOT require this filter

**Blind Deconvolution**
- **What it does**: Attempts blur removal when blur type is unknown (automatic detection)
- **When to use**: Unclear blur cause, complex mixed blur types
- **Key parameters**: Auto-detect mode, iteration limit
- **Situation**: Unknown blur source requiring automatic analysis
- **Example**: Blurry image of unknown origin - "Blind Deconvolution → Auto mode → Software analyzes and estimates blur kernel automatically"
- **Limitation**: Less accurate than specific deblur types; use as last resort
- **Best practice**: Always try specific deblur types (Motion/Optical) before Blind Deconvolution
