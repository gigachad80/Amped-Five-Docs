### 2.8 DENOISE MODULE
**Purpose**: Remove noise, compression artifacts, and grain

#### **Filters & Sub-Filters**:

**Averaging Filter**
- **What it does**: Simple mean of surrounding pixels
- **When to use**: AVOID - obsolete algorithm
- **Verdict**: DO NOT USE - blurs edges as much as noise; replaced by Bilateral Filter

**Gaussian Filter**
- **What it does**: Weighted average with Gaussian kernel (center pixels weighted higher)
- **When to use**: Gentle denoise on relatively clean images
- **Key parameters**: Kernel size (3×3, 5×5, 7×7), sigma (spread)
- **Situation**: Mild noise on already decent-quality image
- **Example**: Clean photo with slight grain - "Gaussian 5×5, sigma 1.0 → Gentle smoothing"
- **Limitation**: Still blurs edges more than Bilateral Filter
- **Better alternative**: Bilateral Filter for forensic work

**Median Filter**
- **What it does**: Replaces each pixel with median of surrounding pixels
- **When to use**: SPECIALIZED - salt-and-pepper impulse noise (random black/white pixels)
- **Key parameters**: Kernel size (MUST be odd: 3×3, 5×5, 7×7)
- **Situation**: Isolated noise spikes, sensor defects, transmission errors
- **Example**: Image with random white/black pixel speckles - "Median Filter 5×5 → Isolated pixels replaced with median of neighbors → Salt-pepper noise removed"
- **Edge preservation**: EXCELLENT - maintains sharp boundaries
- **Specific use**: Any image with isolated random pixel noise
- **Does NOT work well on**: Gaussian noise (smooth random noise) - use Bilateral instead

**Wiener Filter**
- **What it does**: Minimizes mean square error between original and processed image
- **When to use**: General image degradation (blur + noise combined), post-transmission degradation
- **Key parameters**: Noise variance (auto-estimate or manual), degradation model
- **Situation**: General restoration when both blur and noise present
- **Example**: Degraded transmitted video - "Wiener Filter → Auto noise estimate → Restores degraded areas by minimizing error"
- **Advantage**: Context-aware, handles combined degradation types
- **Caution**: Can over-process already-clean images

**Bilateral Filter**
- **What it does**: FORENSIC GOLD STANDARD - denoise while preserving edges
- **When to use**: DEFAULT denoise choice for forensic work
- **Key parameters**: 
  - **Space_sigma** (20-40): Spatial neighborhood distance weight
    - 20 = smaller neighborhood (preserves more fine detail)
    - 30 = typical balanced setting
    - 40 = larger neighborhood (stronger denoise)
  - **Range_sigma** (0.1-0.3): Intensity similarity weight
    - 0.1 = strict similarity requirement (preserves edges best)
    - 0.2 = typical balanced setting
    - 0.3 = looser similarity (stronger denoise, slight edge softening)
  - **Iterations** (1-3): Number of times to apply filter
    - 1 = light denoise
    - 2 = moderate (typical)
    - 3 = strong denoise
- **Situation**: Faces, documents, detailed objects with noise
- **Example - Low-light face**: "Bilateral → Space 30, Range 0.2, Iterations 2 → Noise removed 60-70%, facial edges remain sharp"
- **Example - Noisy document**: "Bilateral → Space 25, Range 0.15, Iterations 1 → Text edges preserved, background noise reduced"
- **Mechanism**: Uses BOTH spatial distance AND intensity similarity - only averages similar pixels
- **Best for**: Faces, text, edges that must stay sharp
- **Verdict**: Best balance of noise removal + edge preservation in forensic work

**Rational Smoothing**
- **What it does**: Advanced curvature-driven smoothing (newer alternative to Bilateral)
- **When to use**: When Bilateral Filter insufficient, newer Amped FIVE versions only
- **Key parameters**: Smoothing strength, curvature sensitivity
- **Situation**: Structured noise that Bilateral doesn't fully resolve
- **Advantage**: Smoother result on certain noise types
- **Availability**: Requires Amped FIVE version 2020+

**Deblocking Filter**
- **What it does**: Removes H.264/MPEG compression block artifacts
- **When to use**: Visible 8×8 or 16×16 block grid, mosquito noise, DVR/CCTV footage
- **Key parameters**: Strength (0.5-1.0), block size detection
- **Situation**: Compressed DVR footage, H.264 video, MPEG recordings
- **Example**: Compressed CCTV - "Check Macroblocks visualization → See 16×16 grid → Deblocking strength 0.7 → Block boundaries smoothed"
- **Workflow position**: Apply FIRST if blocks visible (before other denoise filters)
- **Follow with**: Bilateral → Unsharp Masking
- **Recognition**: 8×8 or 16×16 visible grid pattern on image
