## 2.11 MEASURE MODULE (Forensic Measurements & Calculations)
**Purpose**: Quantitative analysis, dimensional measurement, speed estimation

#### **Filters & Sub-Filters**:

**Measure 1D (Linear Measurement)**
- **What it does**: Single dimension measurement (length, width, height)
- **When to use**: Weapon length, wound size, object dimensions
- **Key parameters**: Reference object known length, measurement line
- **Prerequisites**: Known reference in image (scale card, known object dimension)
- **Situation**: Measure knife length, bullet hole diameter, tire track width
- **Example**: Weapon measurement
  1. Measure reference (scale card): 30cm = 450 pixels
  2. Set reference: 450px = 30cm
  3. Draw line on weapon blade: 280 pixels
  4. Calculation: (280px / 450px) × 30cm = 18.67cm blade length
- **Accuracy**: ±1-3% with proper setup and distortion correction
- **Critical**: Distortion MUST be corrected before measurement (Undistort/Correct Fisheye first)

**Measure 2D (2D Geometric Measurement)**
- **What it does**: Area, perimeter, geometric shape analysis
- **When to use**: Bloodstain area, impression region, wound circumference
- **Key parameters**: Polygon ROI selection, reference calibration
- **Measurement types**:
  - **Area**: Surface area measurement (cm², in²)
  - **Perimeter**: Boundary length
  - **Ratios**: Width/height for object classification
- **Situation**: Bloodstain pattern analysis, impression evidence dimensions
- **Example**: Bloodstain area - "Draw polygon around stain perimeter → Software calculates area: 42.3 cm²"
- **Accuracy**: ±2-5% depending on ROI precision and distortion correction

**Measure 3D (Photogrammetry - Height/Depth from 2D)**
- **What it does**: Estimates height/depth from single 2D image using photogrammetry
- **When to use**: Suspect height estimation, object depth calculation
- **Prerequisites**:
  1. Distortion CORRECTED (Undistort/Correct Fisheye FIRST - MANDATORY)
  2. Vertical calibration object visible in image
  3. Known reference object height
- **Key parameters**: 
  - Vertical axis line
  - Horizontal baseline
  - Reference object height
- **Situation**: Suspect height from surveillance video
- **Example**: Height estimation
  1. Correct Fisheye distortion FIRST (critical!)
  2. Mark vertical axis (wall edge, door frame)
  3. Mark horizontal baseline (floor level)
  4. Measure reference (door height): 2.1m
  5. Measure subject: Software calculates 1.78m ± 1.3cm
- **Typical accuracy**: ±1.3cm standard deviation (validated research)
- **CRITICAL**: Distortion correction MANDATORY - without it: ±30cm error vs. ±1.3cm with correction
- **Workflow sequence**: Undistort/Fisheye correction → THEN Measure 3D

**Speed Estimation 2D**
- **What it does**: Calculates vehicle/object velocity from video
- **When to use**: Traffic enforcement, accident reconstruction, velocity-dependent incidents
- **Prerequisites**:
  - **Frame rate**: MUST be verified accurate (check metadata!)
  - **Distance reference**: Known distance in image (road markings, measured distance)
  - **Path tracking**: Subject tracked across multiple frames
- **Key parameters**: 
  - Frame rate (CRITICAL - biggest error source)
  - Reference distance
  - Object path
- **Situation**: Vehicle speed calculation from CCTV
- **Example**: Speed estimation
  1. Verify frame rate: 29.97 fps (check metadata!)
  2. Measure reference distance: Lane width 3.7m = 180 pixels
  3. Track vehicle across frames: Frame 10 → Frame 45 (35 frames)
  4. Distance traveled: 15 lane widths = 55.5m
  5. Time: 35 frames / 29.97 fps = 1.168 seconds
  6. Speed: 55.5m / 1.168s = 47.5 m/s = 171 km/h
- **Accuracy**: ±3-10% with proper calibration
- **Error sources**: Frame rate uncertainty is #1 error source
- **Legal note**: Always report error margin - cannot claim higher precision than methodology supports

**Perspective Aligner**
- **What it does**: Aligns multiple images for comparison
- **When to use**: Fingerprint comparison, image registration, overlay comparison
- **Key parameters**: 3-4+ landmark points, geometric transformation model
- **Situation**: Align questioned fingerprint to known print for comparison
- **Example**: Print comparison
  1. Load reference print (known)
  2. Load test print (questioned)
  3. Click 3-4 corresponding minutiae points on both
  4. Software calculates geometric transform
  5. Aligns test to reference orientation
- **Output**: Normalized orientation for side-by-side comparison
- **Use**: AFIS-like preparation for print comparison, image overlay
