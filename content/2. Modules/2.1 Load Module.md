### 2.1 LOAD MODULE
**Purpose**: Import, organize, and prepare media files for analysis

#### **Filters & Sub-Filters**:

**Load Images/Videos**
- **What it does**: Imports image/video files into the project workspace
- **When to use**: Always the first step in any workflow
- **Key parameters**: File path selection, codec detection
- **Situation**: Starting any forensic analysis
- **Example**: Import CCTV footage from DVR system - "Load → Browse to .mp4 file → Verify metadata displays correctly"
- **Best practice**: Always verify file integrity with Hash Code immediately after loading

**Duplicate Remover**
- **What it does**: Identifies and removes identical or near-identical consecutive frames
- **When to use**: CCTV with static scenes, surveillance footage with minimal motion
- **Key parameters**: Similarity threshold (95-99% typical)
- **Situation**: 8-hour store surveillance video where only 10 minutes contain motion
- **Example**: Retail theft investigation - "Load 8hr video → Duplicate Remover (threshold 98%) → Reduces 28,800 frames to 1,200 frames → 20× faster processing"
- **Results**: 20-50% file size reduction in static scenes
- **Caution**: Do NOT use when all frames are legally required for evidence continuity

**Auto Selector**
- **What it does**: Ranks frames by quality metrics (sharpness, contrast, brightness) and keeps top N frames
- **When to use**: Variable quality recording, need best representative frames
- **Key parameters**: Number of frames to retain, quality metric weights
- **Situation**: Moving vehicle with 200 frames of license plate, only need 10 best quality frames
- **Example**: Hit-and-run investigation - "Auto Selector → Set quality threshold 80% → Keep top 15 frames → Reduces 200 frames to 15 highest-clarity frames"
- **Caution**: Not suitable when temporal continuity is legally required

**Demultiplexer**
- **What it does**: Separates single file containing multiple camera views (quad-split, grid layouts)
- **When to use**: Multi-camera recordings stored as single composite video
- **Key parameters**: Grid pattern (2×2, 3×3, etc.), camera positions
- **Situation**: ATM surveillance with 4 cameras recorded as single 2×2 grid video
- **Example**: Bank robbery - "Demultiplexer → Select 2×2 grid → Extract 4 individual camera streams → Analyze each camera independently"
- **Result**: Individual streams for independent enhancement and analysis

**Motion Detection**
- **What it does**: Detects movement in specified region of interest (ROI)
- **When to use**: Long surveillance footage, need to locate activity moments
- **Key parameters**: ROI coordinates, sensitivity threshold, minimum motion duration
- **Situation**: 12-hour parking lot footage, need only moments when person enters frame
- **Example**: Vandalism investigation - "Motion Detection → Draw ROI around vehicle → Sensitivity 15% → Extract 8 motion events from 12hr footage (43,200 frames → 240 frames)"
- **Output**: Timestamps of motion events for rapid navigation
