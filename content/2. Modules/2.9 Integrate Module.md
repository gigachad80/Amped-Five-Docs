### 2.9 INTEGRATE MODULE (Multi-Frame Processing)
**Purpose**: Combine information from multiple frames for enhancement

#### **Filters & Sub-Filters**:

**Temporal Smoothing**
- **What it does**: Multi-frame averaging denoise using frame history
- **When to use**: Static or low-motion scenes with multiple frames available
- **Key parameters**: 
  - **Frame size** (3-5 typical): Number of frames to average
    - 3 frames = conservative (minimal ghosting risk)
    - 5 frames = typical balanced setting
    - 7+ frames = aggressive (risk ghosting on motion)
- **Situation**: Static surveillance camera, stationary subject, minimal motion
- **Example**: Store surveillance (static camera) - "Temporal Smoothing size 5 → Averages 5 consecutive frames → 50-70% noise reduction"
- **Result**: Dramatic noise reduction by averaging multiple observations of same scene
- **Trade-off**: Larger frame size = more denoise BUT risk ghosting if motion present
- **When NOT to use**: Fast motion, moving subjects (use Motion Smoothing instead)

**Motion Smoothing**
- **What it does**: Frame averaging that accounts for object movement
- **When to use**: When Temporal Smoothing causes ghosting due to motion
- **Key parameters**: Frame size (3-5), motion detection sensitivity
- **Situation**: Moving subject with camera tracking, object motion during multi-frame sequence
- **Example**: Walking person - "Temporal Smoothing caused ghost trails → Switch to Motion Smoothing size 5 → Tracks subject motion, averages correctly aligned frames → No ghosting"
- **Benefit**: Denoise without motion blur/ghost trails
- **Workflow**: Try Temporal Smoothing first; if ghosting appears, switch to Motion Smoothing

**Frame Averaging**
- **What it does**: Creates single composite image from multiple frames
- **When to use**: Need single averaged output, not video
- **Key parameters**: Frame range selection, weighting
- **Situation**: Extract clean background, merge multiple recordings
- **Example**: Extract background - "Average 100 frames of people walking through scene → Moving people average out → Clean background plate remains"
- **Output**: Single averaged frame (not video sequence)

**Super Resolution**
- **What it does**: Merges sub-pixel shifts from multiple frames into higher-resolution image
- **When to use**: Multiple frames of same region with slight positional differences
- **Key parameters**: 
  - Frame count (minimum 5-10 for good results)
  - Resolution zoom (1.5×-4× typical)
  - Alignment method
- **Situation**: License plate recorded across multiple frames with camera shake
- **Example**: License plate sequence - "10 frames with slight camera shake → Super Resolution 2× zoom → Merges sub-pixel information → Effective resolution doubled → Characters legible"
- **Prerequisites**: Multiple frames of same region required
- **Resolution gain**: 1.5×-2× improvement typical, up to 4× in ideal conditions
- **Frame requirement**: Minimum 5-10 frames; more frames = better result

**Perspective Stabilization**
- **What it does**: Tracks and aligns object across frames with perspective changes
- **When to use**: Object viewed at changing angles across frames
- **Key parameters**: Tracking points, perspective model, alignment accuracy
- **Situation**: License plate crossing camera view at multiple angles
- **Example**: Plate at angles - "Frame 1: plate at 60° angle → Frame 50: plate frontal → Frame 100: plate at 30° angle → Perspective Stabilization tracks and normalizes all to frontal view"
- **Registration**: Click 3-4 corresponding landmark points on object
- **Output**: All frames aligned to same perspective (frontal appearance)
- **Critical before**: Super Resolution when angle changes present

**Perspective Super Resolution**
- **What it does**: Combined Perspective Stabilization + Super Resolution in one filter
- **When to use**: Moving plate/object at angles requiring both stabilization and resolution increase
- **Key parameters**: Frame count, zoom factor, perspective accuracy
- **Situation**: Vehicle license plate moving across frame with changing viewing angles
- **Example**: Moving plate - "Perspective Super Resolution → Automatic stabilization → Merges 15 frames → 2×-3× resolution improvement → Plate legible despite movement and angles"
- **Efficiency**: Single filter instead of two separate operations
- **Resolution gain**: 2×-3× improvement typical
- **Workflow**: Handles complex real-world scenarios automatically
