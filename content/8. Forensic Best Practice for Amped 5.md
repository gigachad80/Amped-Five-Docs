## 8. FORENSIC BEST PRACTICES

### 8.1 Chain of Custody
1. **Hash original file** immediately after loading (SHA-256)
2. **Document hash** in case file/report
3. **Process with non-destructive workflow** (all filters reversible)
4. **Export enhanced version**
5. **Generate new hash** for enhanced version
6. **Report both hashes** - proves original preserved, enhancement documented

### 8.2 Scientific Defensibility
1. **Use scientifically validated filters only** (all Amped FIVE filters validated)
2. **Document all parameters used** (Amped auto-documents in report)
3. **Include Compare Original** before/after visualization
4. **Report accuracy limitations** (e.g., Measure 3D: ±1.3cm standard deviation)
5. **Never overclaim certainty** - always provide error margins

### 8.3 Court Presentation
1. **Always include Compare Original** side-by-side
2. **Annotate with clear labels** (frame numbers, measurements, scale references)
3. **Use professional presentation** (Annotate filter for comprehensive markup)
4. **Document methodology** (which filters applied, in what order, why)
5. **Be prepared to explain** each filter's scientific basis

### 8.4 Privacy & Redaction
1. **Redact third-party privacy** (bystander faces, innocent parties)
2. **Use appropriate redaction method**:
   - Blur for soft anonymization
   - Pixelate for stronger redaction
   - Black box for full information security
3. **Comply with GDPR/data protection** laws
4. **Document what was redacted and why**
