### 3.2 CRITICAL WORKFLOW PRINCIPLES

**Principle 1: Filter Order Matters (Image Generation Model)**
- Defects created during capture: **Distortion → Blur → Compression → Noise**
- Recovery must REVERSE this order
- **Correct sequence**: Denoise → Deblur → Undistort → Enhance
- **Wrong sequence consequences**: Partially unreadable or illegible output

**Principle 2: Distortion Correction BEFORE Measurement**
- Fisheye/Barrel/Pincushion distortion MUST be corrected FIRST
- **Without correction**: 5-40% measurement error  
- **With correction**: ±1.3cm typical accuracy
- **Workflow**: Undistort/Correct Fisheye → THEN Measure 3D

**Principle 3: Fingerprints Require Resize 1:1 ONLY**
- AFIS requires minimum 1000 DPI with exact pixel preservation
- **NEVER use Smart Resize** for fingerprints
- **Always use Resize 1:1** - preserves DPI metadata and pixel count

**Principle 4: Deblur BEFORE Sharpen**
- Sharpening before deblur = amplified blur artifacts
- **Correct**: Deblur → Denoise → Sharpen
- **Wrong**: Sharpen → Deblur = poor results

**Principle 5: Temporal Integration BEFORE Single-Frame Enhancement**
- Multiple frames provide more information than single noisy frame
- **Better**: Temporal Smoothing (5 frames) → Denoise → Sharpen
- **Worse**: Heavy denoise on single frame
