### 3.1 RECOMMENDED GLOBAL WORKFLOW SEQUENCE

```
PHASE 1: IMPORT & DIAGNOSTICS
1. LOAD → Import media
2. ANALYZE → Hash Code (SHA-256), Metadata, Histogram
3. INTERLACE → Deinterlace (if interlaced source)

PHASE 2: RESTORATION (Reverse order of defect introduction)
4. DENOISE → Bilateral Filter (if noisy) OR Deblocking (if compressed)
5. DEBLUR → Motion/Optical/Variable as appropriate
6. EDIT → Undistort/Correct Fisheye (BEFORE measurement!)

PHASE 3: INTEGRATION (If multi-frame available)
7. INTEGRATE → Perspective Stabilization, Super Resolution

PHASE 4: ENHANCEMENT
8. ADJUST → CLAHE/Levels/Curves (tone correction)
9. EXTRACT → Color Deconvolution/Fourier (task-specific)
10. SHARPEN → Unsharp Masking

PHASE 5: MEASUREMENT & ANALYSIS
11. MEASURE → 1D/2D/3D, Speed Estimation (only after restoration!)

PHASE 6: PRESENTATION
12. PRESENT → Compare Original, Annotate, Redact
13. Export & Report Generation
