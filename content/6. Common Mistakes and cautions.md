## 6. COMMON MISTAKES & CAUTIONS

### Mistake 1: Wrong Filter Order
❌ **WRONG**: Sharpen → Deblur → Denoise
✅ **CORRECT**: Denoise → Deblur → Sharpen

**Why**: Sharpening before deblur amplifies blur artifacts; deblurring noisy images amplifies noise

---

### Mistake 2: Measuring Before Distortion Correction
❌ **WRONG**: Measure 3D directly on fisheye image
✅ **CORRECT**: Correct Fisheye → Post Projection → THEN Measure 3D

**Why**: ±30cm measurement error vs. ±1.3cm error - 20× accuracy difference

---

### Mistake 3: Using Smart Resize on Fingerprints
❌ **WRONG**: Smart Resize fingerprint image
✅ **CORRECT**: Resize 1:1 ONLY for fingerprints

**Why**: AFIS requires exact pixel preservation and 1000+ DPI; interpolation invalidates comparison

---

### Mistake 4: Applying Fourier Filter to Random Noise
❌ **WRONG**: Fourier Filter for Gaussian noise
✅ **CORRECT**: Fourier ONLY for periodic patterns; use Bilateral for random noise

**Why**: Fourier works on frequency-domain periodic components, not spatial random noise

---

### Mistake 5: Using Laplacian on Noisy/Compressed Footage
❌ **WRONG**: Laplacian sharpening on noisy CCTV
✅ **CORRECT**: Bilateral denoise → Unsharp Masking with threshold

**Why**: Laplacian severely amplifies noise; Unsharp threshold protects low-contrast areas

---

### Mistake 6: Histogram Equalization on Mixed Lighting
❌ **WRONG**: Histogram Eq on backlit subject
✅ **CORRECT**: CLAHE with ROI on subject

**Why**: Global histogram eq amplifies noise and creates unnatural look in mixed lighting

---

### Mistake 7: Large Temporal Smoothing on Motion
❌ **WRONG**: Temporal Smoothing size 9 on moving subject
✅ **CORRECT**: Motion Smoothing size 5 OR smaller Temporal size 3

**Why**: Large frame sizes cause ghosting on moving objects

---

### Mistake 8: Skipping Hash Code Documentation
❌ **WRONG**: Process without initial hash
✅ **CORRECT**: Hash (SHA-256) → Process → Export → New hash → Document both

**Why**: Chain of custody requirement; proves original preserved, enhancement transparent

---

### Mistake 9: Not Verifying Frame Rate for Speed Estimation
❌ **WRONG**: Assume 30fps without checking
✅ **CORRECT**: Verify frame rate in metadata before Speed Estimation 2D

**Why**: Frame rate error = speed calculation error; #1 source of measurement error

---

### Mistake 10: Forgetting Compare Original
❌ **WRONG**: Export only enhanced version
✅ **CORRECT**: Always include Compare Original in court reports

**Why**: Legal requirement to demonstrate no fabrication; transparency for admissibility
